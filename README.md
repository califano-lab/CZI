# CZI project


We have optimized the VIPER methodology (Alvarez et al.,Nature Genetics,2016)  to infer protein activity from  single cell gene expression data and present a new computational pipeline called PISCES (Protein Activity Inference in Single CEllS).
The application of PISCES  to 72,160 cells from 5 different tissues derived from 5 donors  successfully defined tissue-specific T-cell regulatory networks and master regulators.
